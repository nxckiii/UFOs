# UFOs - Aliens <3

# OVERVIEW
The purpose of the project was to introduce how JavaScript works. It has a from-to-end development language with extra functions and creative ways to customize it. JavaScript has been around since 1995, and it has enhanced the user's experience. This challenge was to create a web page focusing on space into an HTML page, using CSS and Bootstrap. 

# RESULTS: For Dana
This website is a stepping stone in the right direction of having valid, accurate information. It has a table that can be filtered and show its UFO-related recordings.

# SUMMARY
While the website's structure is concise, the website's color is offputting. I tried a color without clashing the words; however, the header's color clashes with the title. Unfortunately, the NASA picture didn't upload correctly. If you go to the style.css file, double-check for discrepancies. 

As someone who also loves science and wonders about UFOs, Dana should consider creating tabs for her websiteâ€”for example, putting all the data (old to new) in one tab for credential purposes.
